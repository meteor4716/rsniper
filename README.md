# ROBLOX Item Sniper by meteor4716

## Overview

This is a sniper bot for ROBLOX items and limiteds depending on your budget. It will automatically purchase items below a certain percentage threshold and either resell them for a higher price or keep them in the user's inventory. This sniper can be used to quickly obtain more Robux (R$) or limiteds and other rare items.

## Items Overview

This bot will snipe limiteds or other rare items depending on your Robux (R$) budget. The bot will search for the best snipes by finding items being sold for a percentage of the usual sales for that item. Once the sniper finds an item that is below the target threshold, it will purchase the item and either post it for sale at a higher price or keep it in the user's inventory. Please view the [ROBLOX Fandom](https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Limited_items) for more information on limiteds.
